📊 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company. The goal is to help businesses proactively identify customers likely to leave and take actions to retain them, reducing potential revenue loss.


✅ Project Objectives:
Analyze and understand telecom customer data.
Identify key factors affecting churn such as:
Contract type.
Tenure.
Monthly charges.
Build and compare several classification models.
Improve the model using hyperparameter tuning.
Interpret results and provide practical business recommendations.
Deploy the model with an interactive interface for testing customer data.

🚀 Project Workflow:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Data cleaning and handling missing values.
Data transformation and encoding categorical features.
Model building (XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.).
Model evaluation using metrics such as Accuracy, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
Deployment on Hugging Face for public access.

🔍 Results:
The best performance was achieved using the XGBoost model with an accuracy of 76%.
The most influential factors in churn prediction were:
Tenure.
Contract type.
Monthly charges.
